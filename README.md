# asteroids
This is a remake of the classic Asteroids Atari game.  The goal of the game is to last as long as possible while flying around space and shooting asteroids and enemies.  As the game progresses, it gets gradually harder until the player runs out of lives.  This is made in python using pygame.  Currently a work in progress.

# Usage
Navigate to the file location of the Main.py class using the command line. Compile and run the program by using the following code: 
py Main.py

# FINISHED:
