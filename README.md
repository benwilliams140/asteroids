# asteroids
This is a remake of the classic Asteroids Atari game.  The goal of the game is to last as long as possible while flying around space and shooting asteroids and enemies.  As the game progresses, it gets gradually harder until the player runs out of lives.  This is made in python using pygame.  Currently a work in progress.

# FINISHED:
- Basic spaceship movement and rotation
- Spaceship screen wrapping

- Progressive difficulty

# TODO:
- Implement menu system
- Asteroid and spaceship collision
- Spaceship shooting
- Asteroid and bullet collision
- Implement different enemies
- Score system
